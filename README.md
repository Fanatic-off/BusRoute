# BusRoute

There are N buses, each bus travels along a pre-known cyclic route. 
The fare is known (paid at the entrance to the bus) and the travel time between stops. 
Buses enter the route (appear at the first stop) at a certain time.

It is necessary to write a program that will find two ways: the cheapest way and the fastest way. 
The program interface should allow you to download a file with bus routes, select the starting and ending points and the departure time from the starting point.
